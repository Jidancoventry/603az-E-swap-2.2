## Run locally

Open the `frontend` folder in VS Code, then run:

```powershell
npm.cmd install
npm.cmd run dev
```

Open the exact localhost address shown by Vite.

To run the included escrow and data-integrity checks:

```powershell
npm.cmd test
```

To verify the production build:

```powershell
npm.cmd run build
```

## Account and role model

- A person registers with their own email and receives the `user` role.
- Every user can both buy and sell; buyer and seller are transaction positions, not separate account roles.
- Administrators supervise users, listings, escrow, recycling and conversations.
- Administrator access is granted only by adding a confirmed Cognito account to the `Admins` group.
- The public registration form can never create an administrator.

## Deploy to AWS

For the AWS Academy-compatible manual deployment in **US East (N. Virginia) `us-east-1`**, follow `MANUAL_DEPLOYMENT_US_EAST_1.md`. It keeps the existing backend, creates Cognito manually and publishes the frontend through Amplify Hosting without Git.

Read `AWS_DEPLOYMENT.md` for the architecture, security controls, validation checklist, troubleshooting and production upgrade path.

## Important

Local mode stores data in browser `localStorage`. AWS mode uses Cognito for accounts, DynamoDB for application state, S3 for files, API Gateway/Lambda for the backend, and Amplify Hosting for the HTTPS frontend.

Public profiles intentionally exclude email addresses, wallet history, orders, private messages and moderation information. Those records remain visible only to their owner or an authorized administrator.

E-Tokens are prototype credits only. They are not money and cannot be withdrawn.
